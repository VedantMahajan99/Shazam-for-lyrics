We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort.
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly.
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name (call out my name).
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (I want you to stay).
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?).
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and.
I'll be on my
I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied.
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop.
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time.
You're on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe.
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name (call out my name, baby).
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me.
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby).
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl
I'll be on my.
On my way, all the way

Twenty racks a table cut from ebony.

You talking money, need a hearing aid.

Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish.
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars.

I been tryna call
I been on my own for long enough.
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals.
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby.
I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh).
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby.
Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone.
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone).
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.

I'm findin' ways to articulate
The feeling I'm goin' through.
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know.
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah.
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me.
Hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely
'Specially in the night.
I'm scared that I'll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'.
I can't afford love
I try to find reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it.
I can't walk away, oh!
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you.
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby.
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you.
Just don't blame me too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better.
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe.
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes.
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect.
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone.
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us.
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah.
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby.
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you.
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na.
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone.
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us.
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe.
