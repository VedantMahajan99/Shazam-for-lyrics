We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out.
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see.
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together.
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds.
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again.
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real
I'm crying (Yes I'm crying).
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
And be can't build our dreams.
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes.
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know.
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah
We're caught in a trap.
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby.
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me.
When you don't believe a word I say?
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out.
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out.
Because I love you too much baby.

Well, since my baby left me.
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel.
Where I'll be--where I get so lonely, baby
Well, I'm so lonely.
I get so lonely, I could die
Although it's always crowded.
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom.
And be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely.
They'll be so lonely, they could die
Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
Well, they'll never, they'll never get back.
And they'll be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely.
They'll be so lonely, they could die
Well now, if your baby leaves you
And you have a sad tale to tell.
Just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel
And you will be, you will be, you will be lonely, baby
You'll be so lonely.
You'll be so lonely, you could die
Well, though it's always crowded
You still can find some room.
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom.
And they'll be so, they'll be so lonely, baby
They'll be so lonely.
They'll be so lonely, they could die.

Home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home.
I don't need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere you're with me is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone.
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch.
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home.
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch.
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home.

I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So, darling, please, be careful.
You know I care a lot
Darling, please, don't break my heart
I beg of you.
I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry.
But that's what's bound to happen
If you only say goodbye.
Darling, please, don't say goodbye
I beg of you.
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true.
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you, little girl
You got me at your mercy.
Now that I'm in love with you
So, please, don't take advantage.
'Cause you know my love is true
Darling, please, please, love me too
I beg of you.
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true.
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you, little girl
You got me at your mercy.
Now that I'm in love with you
So, please, don't take advantage.
'Cause you know my love is true
Darling, please, please, love me too
I beg of you.
Darling, please, please, love me too
I beg of you.
Darling, please, please, love me too
I beg of you.

Well, it's one for the money.
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go.
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name all over the place.
Well do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey lay off of them shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes
Let's go, cat!.
Ah, walk the dog
You can burn my house.
Steal my car
Drink my liquor.
From an old fruit jar
Well do anything that you want to do.
But uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes.
Rock it
Yeah
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready.
Now go, go, go!
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, it's
Blue, blue.
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes, yeah!
Blue, blue.
Blue, suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue.
Blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes.
