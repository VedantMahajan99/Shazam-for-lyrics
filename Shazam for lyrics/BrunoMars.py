Let's take our time tonight, girl.
Above us all the stars are watchin'.
There's no place I'd rather be in this world.
Your eyes are where I'm lost in.
Underneath the chandelier.
We're dancin' all alone.
There's no reason to hide.
What we're feelin' inside.
Right now.
So baby let's just turn down the lights.
And close the door.
Ooh I love that dress.
But you won't need it anymore.
No you won't need it no more.
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby.
Versace on the floor.
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl.
Versace on the floor.
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl, mmm.
I unzip the back to watch it fall.
While I kiss your neck and shoulders.
No don't be afraid to show it all.
I'll be right here ready to hold you.
Girl you know you're perfect from.
Your head down to your heels.
Don't be confused by my smile.
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real.
So just turn down the lights (down the lights).
And close the door (close the door).
Ooh I love that dress.
But you won't need it anymore.
No you won't need it no more.
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby.
Versace on the floor.
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl.
Versace on the floor.
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl.
Dance.

(It's warmin' up) can you feel it?.
(It's warmin' up) can you feel it, baby?.
(It's warmin' up).
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more.
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked.
Ooh, Versace on the floor, hey baby.
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl.
Versace on the floor.
Oh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl.
Versace on the floor.
Floor.

If you ever leave me baby,.
Leave some morphine at my door.
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication.
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.
There's no religion that could save me.
No matter how long my knees are on the floor.
Ooh so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'.
Will keep you by my side.
Will keep you from walkin' out the door.
'Cause there'll be no sunlight.
If I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies.
If I lose you, baby.
Just like the clouds.
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it will rain.
I'll never be your mother's favorite.
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye.
Ooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin there goes my little girl.
Walkin' with that troublesome guy.
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand.
Ooh but little darlin' watch me change their minds.
Yea for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try.
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding.
If that'll make you mine.
'Cause there'll be no sunlight.
If I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies.
If I lose you, baby.
Just like the clouds.
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away.
Everyday it will rain.
Don't you say, goodbye.
Don't you say, goodbye.
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding.
If that'll make it right.
'Cause there'll be no sunlight.
If I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies.
If I lose you, baby.
Just like the clouds.
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away.
Everyday it will rain.

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,.
I'll sail the world to find you.
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,.
I'll be the light to guide you.
Find out what we're made of.
When we are called to help our friends in need.
You can count on me like one two three.
I'll be there.
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two.
You'll be there.
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah.
Whoa, whoa.
Oh, oh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep.
I'll sing a song.
Beside you.
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me.
Everyday I will.
Remind you.

Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
